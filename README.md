# Stylometry and statistics

In authorship attribution, the calculation of delta values, e.g. Burrow's Delta, is a commonly used method. This project is an attempt to determine a certain value of delta to differentiate between identical and different creatorship and to assign authorship as precisely as possible across unseen corpora.
